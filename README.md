* D11 temperature and humidity sensor
* RPI HC-SR501 motion sensor
* 220kΩ and 10kΩ resistor
* LED diode
* 3 way switch 

Other components:

* Soldering iron

## Content of the project

Project contains schema, sketch file for the WifiKit and Flask code for the web application accepting the data from the device and serving web page to visually inspect data (on a plot).

The code for web app was hosted for free on PythonAnywhere.com
